            <p>Currently translating the code from a PHP Symfony Project to Django.</p>
            <p>I wanted a change from PHP, and I have enjoyed python, so I have decied to build this in Django, and will release a development version as soon 
as I have gotten it to a valid state, if only 'just' working, and will then continue to develop it publicly.<br>
