<h3>About Me</h3>

<p>
I am a programmer based in Melbourne Australia, who also enjoys Photography, Videography and Sound Engineering.<br>

I have been developing small websites, and applications for a while now, and am getting a grasp on git.<br>

I am a big fan of OpenSource Software, and want to do all that I am able to contribute to it.<br>

I have been using Linux as my main operating system, <a href="http://archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a> on both of my laptops, for a number of years now, and do 
not 
plan on going back to closed source software, or OS's.<br>

I am wanting to get more involved with the OpenSource community, and continue develop software.<br>
